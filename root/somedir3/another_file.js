 * It's common to see TODOs in code. It's also common for TODOs to remain as to-dos for a long time. 
 * One way we can solve this problem is to have a service that runs through all files in a given directory and checks for any instances of the key-phrase "TODO", 
 * flagging each one of them out for humans to continue working on them.
